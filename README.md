# Web-Shop-API with Node.js and MongoDB


#### This is only a back end of web shop API. It was created as a clone of [Lama Dev](https://github.com/safak) e-commerce app with small changes.
#### Use **Postman** or a similar program to test it. 

**Dependencies:**
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
```
npm i express
```
* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
```
npm i nodemon
```
* [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.
```
npm i mongoose
```
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

```
* [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.
